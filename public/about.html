<h3>"DON'T STOP UNTIL YOU'RE PROUD."</h3>

<p> It's nice to e-meet you! I am Rafael Gadut, a Philippine-based virtual assistant with 
more than five years of experience in the field. I have worked with BPO company for 
four years and recently shifted to freelancing because I find myself more efficient 
working from home.</p>

<p> A fun fact about myself is that I love playing computer games, especially RPGs and 
adventure genres like Genshin Impact and Pokemon. I love road trips with friends and 
family. I also love to binge-watch series and movies. I am also a fur parent to a 
one-year old Himalayan-Persian cat.</p>
